# create-react-game

> **Note:** You have stumbled across my `create-react-game` generator project. It doesn't do anything terribly useful yet. The aim, of course, is to provide a `yarn create react-game` type experience for quickly bootstrapping game projects powered by React, Three.js, and a curated selection of libraries from the ecosystem.

> If you want to follow progress on this, I would recommend that you subscribe to the [Roadmap Issue](https://github.com/hmans/create-react-game/issues/1).
